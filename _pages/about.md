I recently graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno and am currently on the job market!

My interests fall into three main categories: robotics, data science, and algorithm development. Specifically, I am interested in applying techniques from task learning/scheduling, machine learning, and natural language processing to each of these areas to work towards more explainable AI. My aim is to perform research in one or more of these areas in order to help further the state-of-the art and work on interesting projects which benefit society in some way.

Previously, I completed by M.S. in Computer Science at University of Nevada, Reno and my B.S. in Applied Mathematics at University of Nevada, Reno. I have also worked as a software engineering intern at Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC).
