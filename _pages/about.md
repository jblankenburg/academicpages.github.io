Hello World! Welcome to the home page of Janelle Blankenburg. 

I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Reno. I will be finishing my Ph.D. in May 2020 (expected). 

My research interests are multi-robot/human-robot hierarchical task allocation and generalized task learning using machine learning techniques. These interests are motivated by the desire for muti-robot/human-robot teams to work efficiently and safely together for assembly and other household tasks as well as to allow humans to improve robots' abilities to perform these tasks through use of human provided demonstrations.  

Previously, I completed by M.S. in Computer Science at University of Nevada, Reno and my B.S. in Applied Mathematics at University of Nevada, Reno.
