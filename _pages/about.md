I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Fellow in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Reno. I will be finishing my Ph.D. in May 2020 (expected). 

My research interests are generalized task learning, natural language processing, and machine learning for robotics applications. These interests are motivated by the desire for creating a seamless workflow for collaborative muti-robot/human-robot teams in both industrial and household environments. I aim to develop a generalized task learning framework along with an effective communication method between agents. The goal is for a human to provide both physical and verbal demonstrations to teach the robot to perform a task. In household environments, users would be able to utilize robots for activities of daily living which they are unable to perform themselves. In an industry setting, employees would be able to train robots for new tasks while ensuring they can work alongside the robots safely and reliably.

Previously, I completed by M.S. in Computer Science at University of Nevada, Reno and my B.S. in Applied Mathematics at University of Nevada, Reno.
