Master's Thesis
======
* __Title:__ A Distributed Control Architecture for Collaborative Multi-Robot Task Allocation
* __Description:__ Addressed the problem of task allocation for multi-robot systems that perform tasks with complex,hierarchical representations which contain different types of ordering constraints and multiple paths of execution.Demonstrated the architecture on a team of two humanoid robots (a Baxter and a PR2).  Languages/Tools Used:  C++,Python, Robot Operating System (ROS), MoveIt!.
