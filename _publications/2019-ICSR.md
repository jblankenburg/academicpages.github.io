This paper addresses the problem of human-robot collabo-rative task execution for hierarchical task plans. The main contributionsare the ability for dynamic allocation of tasks in human-robot teams andopportunistic  task  execution  given  different  environmental  conditions.The  human-robot  collaborative  task  is  represented  in  a  tree  structurewhich consists of sequential, non-ordering, and alternative paths of exe-cution. The general approach to enable human-robot collaborative taskexecution is to have the robot maintain an updated, simulated versionof the human’s task representation, which is similar to the robot’s owncontroller for the same task. Continuous peer node message passing be-tween the agents’ task representations enables both to coordinate theirtask execution, so that they perform the task given its required executionconstraints and they do not both work on the same task component. Atea-table task scenario was designed for validation with overlapping andnon-overlapping sub-tasks between a human and a Baxter robot.
