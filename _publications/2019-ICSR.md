This paper addresses the problem of human-robot collaborative task execution for hierarchical task plans. The main contributions are the ability for dynamic allocation of tasks in human-robot teams and opportunistic  task  execution  given  different  environmental  conditions. The  human-robot  collaborative  task  is  represented  in  a  tree  structure which consists of sequential, non-ordering, and alternative paths of execution. The general approach to enable human-robot collaborative task execution is to have the robot maintain an updated, simulated version of the human’s task representation, which is similar to the robot’s own controller for the same task. Continuous peer node message passing between the agents’ task representations enables both to coordinate their task execution, so that they perform the task given its required execution constraints and they do not both work on the same task component. A tea-table task scenario was designed for validation with overlapping and non-overlapping sub-tasks between a human and a Baxter robot.
