Sampling based planning is an important step for
long-range navigation for an autonomous vehicle. This work
proposes a GPU-accelerated sampling based path planning algorithm which can be used as a global planner in autonomous
navigation tasks. A modified version of the generation portion
for the Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm is presented
which reorders some steps of the algorithm in order to allow
for parallelization and thus can benefit highly from utilization
of a GPU. The GPU and CPU algorithms were compared using
a simulated navigation environment with graph generation tasks
of several different sizes. It was found that the GPU-accelerated
version of the PRM algorithm had significant speedup over
the CPU version (up to 78x). This results provides promising
motivation towards implementation of a real-time autonomous
navigation system in the future.
