This research developed a novel approach to robot
task learning from language-based instructions, which focuses
on increasing the complexity of task representations that can
be taught through verbal instruction. The major proposed
contribution is the development of a framework for directly
mapping a complex verbal instruction to an executable task
representation, from a single training experience. The method
can handle the following types of complexities: 1) instructions
that use conjunctions to convey complex execution constraints
(such as alternative paths of execution, sequential or nonordering constraints, as well as hierarchical representations)
and 2) instructions that use prepositions and multiple adjectives
to specify action/object parameters relevant for the task.

Role: Main mentor of undergraduate student.
