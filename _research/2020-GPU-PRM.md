Sampling  based  planning  is  an  important  step  for long-range  navigation  for  an  autonomous  vehicle.  This  work proposes  a  GPU-accelerated  sampling  based  path  planning  algorithm  which  can  be  used  as  a  global  planner  in  autonomous navigation  tasks.  A  modified  version  of  the  generation  portion for  the  Probabilistic  Road  Map  (PRM)  algorithm  is  presented which  reorders  some  steps  of  the  algorithm  in  order  to  allow for  parallelization  and  thus  can  benefit  highly  from  utilization of a GPU. The GPU and CPU algorithms were compared using a simulated navigation environment with graph generation tasks of several different sizes. It was found that the GPU-accelerated version  of  the  PRM  algorithm  had  significant  speedup  over the  CPU  version  (up  to  78x).  This  results  provides  promising motivation  towards  implementation  of  a  real-time  autonomous navigation  system  in  the  future.

Role: Lead graduate researcher.
